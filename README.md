# GDIM 31 Fall 2024

This is the first GDIM31 assignment! This is not a test - just a way to make sure your computer setup is working for GitHub and to get some knowledge about your prior experience. There aren't correct answers for this so please do not be concerned about your grade when filling this out honestly!

## Introduction

1. Tell me a little bit about yourself and your interest in games! Be sure to include your preferred name and pronouns, and talk a little bit about what games you like to play, why you’re taking the class, any prior experience you have with game development, and what kind of games you hope to build.

Hi, I’m Xichan Zheng, my pronouns are she, her, and hers. I’m a freshman majoring in art. Though I’m a fine art student, my favorite form of art is graphic design and communication design. Thus, I’ve always wanted to learn and work in the area of UI design. RPG games like Red Dead Redemption 2 and visual novels such as Ace Attorney are my best-loved genre of games. I’m taking GDIM because I’m considering transferring to a GDIM major, and this is a required class for a change of major. But more importantly, as a gamer, I’m also curious about how lines of code work together to create every game that I enjoy. As a first-year student, my prior experience with game development in general is the board game creation in 8th grade’s design class and card game development about discerning fake news from 11th-12th grade. However, I’m learning 3d modeling software like Blender and a series of visual design tools like Ai, Id, and Ps. As a pixel art lover, I would hope to build a small pixel art JRPG like OMORI and To the Moon.

2. Which of the following best describes your major? Please specify if not GDIM.  

    - [ ] Game Design & Interactive Media
    - [ ] Computer Science or related major (CS, CSE, Data Science, Informatics, etc) (please specify)
    - [Art(the name of this major is just art)] Art-related major (please specify)
    - [ ] Undecided
    - [ ] Other (please specify)

3. What are you hoping to get out of this class?

I hope to gain a basic knowledge of programming so that when I enter the game industry as a visual designer or artist, I can better communicate with different departments of game development by understanding their workflow and needs for visual assets.

4. What, if anything, are you nervous about for this class?

I’m nervous about the coding part as I’ve never learned it in class formally. 

## Prior Experience

The next questions ask about what (if any) prior experience you have. This class assumes students have no prior knowledge, so don’t worry if you have 0 experience programming or with game development! Just write 0 or N/A under the headers. These questions are JUST for us to get an overall picture of the class's experience level so that we can make sure to be meeting you all where you are.

### Development

1. Programming (any languages/ frameworks)

Python

I learned a little about Python over the summer by myself before the school year started. So I know little about the types of variables and some basic coding concepts.

2. Game development (any engine)

N/A

3. Unity

N/A

### Programming & Game Development Concepts

For the next questions, a programming or game development concept is presented:

 - If you are NOT familiar with this topic, write N/A.
 - If you ARE familiar with this concept, do your best to define it in your own words.

**These questions are not graded for accuracy! Answer honestly, don’t Google it.**

1. Game design document
N/A
2. Scope management
N/A
3. Iteration
N/A
4. Object-Oriented programming
N/A
5. Model-View-Controller architecture
N/A
